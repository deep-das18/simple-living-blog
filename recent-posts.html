                    <h2>PURSUING A DREAM WHEN NO ONE CAN SHOW YOU HOW</h2>
                    <p> One of my personal heroes, Jacqueline Novogratz, launched her second book this week.

When I was beginning to explore a career change a few years ago, I picked up…</p>

                    <p>Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, our lives seemed to be moving at breakneck speed. I, especially, had abandoned any past commitment to slow living when I realized that I could do so much more with my time if I just… crammed it all in. I’m embarrassed and humbled to confess that I have unnecessarily worked…</p>

Amidst all the advocacy, commentary, and reporting (and much of this is important), it would be nearly impossible to resist overwhelm. As we consider the various layers…</p>
