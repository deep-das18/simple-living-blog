                    <h2>READY TO FINALLY FOLLOW YOUR HEART? I CAN HELP.</h2>
                    <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been passionate about adventure. And by “adventure,” I mean every opportunity that takes us beyond our comfort zones, allows us to try something new, and to choose hope over fear.

                        Through this blog, I want to help you find your next adventure— whether it’s thoughtfully exploring your dream destination, or finding ways to be more generous everyday.</p>
                    <p>Like everyone in their early twenties (and maybe throughout our lives), I spent a few years trying to discover what I really wanted to do. After 14 years of intense academic schooling, you realize you can’t be a professional critical thinker… and then wonder now what.</p>
                    <p>At the time, I was writing my senior honors thesis in college and it was crushing my spirit. I had always loved writing– so when I found myself hating it and feeling completely congested, I decided to start a blog. It was February 2014, and this was the blog I started.</p>
                    <p>I wrote my first post and hit publish, knowing that no one was going to see my procrastination tactic anyway. Then I published another post, and another, and another. I didn’t tell anyone about it at the time, because the point was to write whatever I wanted with no expectations, no audience.</p>
                    <p>But like so many things in my life, I started working hard on the blog and following in love with the space. I had discovered a whole world of people who blogged, and it was exciting to connect with that world. Months later, after having graduated college, gotten married, extended our honeymoon so we could bury my uncle who passed away unexpectedly, and moved to Los Angeles, I realized that blogging was something I actually loved doing.</p>
